# PharoTask
Repository for the Pharo Task. Implemented in a Pharo 8.0 - 64bits image.

Task request:
The test is to look at the Pharo mooc (http://mooc.pharo.org) and to
implement the following using Pharo:
- a linked list
- a javadoc-like tool that reads a Pharo class and generates a textual
documentation (e.g., markdown, html…).

Each of those items must be validated by unit tests in Pharo.
