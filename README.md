# PharoTask
Repository for the Pharo Task:

The test is to look at the Pharo mooc (http://mooc.pharo.org) and to
implement the following using Pharo:
- a linked list
- a javadoc-like tool that reads a Pharo class and generates a textual
documentation (e.g., markdown, htmlâ€¦).

Each of those items must be validated by unit tests in Pharo.
